## Description

A voting system is a crucial component of any democratic society. Traditionally, voting has been conducted in person at polling stations, which can be time-consuming and inconvenient for voters. Online voting systems provide a more accessible and convenient alternative.

Online voting systems allow users to cast their votes remotely, eliminating the need for physical presence at a polling station. This opens up voting opportunities for individuals who may have difficulty accessing polling stations due to distance, disability, or other constraints.

Furthermore, online voting systems can enhance the overall efficiency and accuracy of the voting process. They can automate tasks such as voter registration, ballot distribution, and vote counting, reducing the likelihood of errors and ensuring a more transparent and reliable election.
